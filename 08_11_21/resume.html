    &#128512; Well.. Who really am I! What am I doing on Earth! It all started around 18 years ago, when our respected
    Queen Se'en wanted to improve our lovely agricultural planet, Simbartia's technological advances... With great haste
    and no planning, she dumped our team into various telemass-commuter (a intergalactic rocket) and launched us off to
    different places in search of usable technology. Honestly, I hate her! If I am to pick even the basic of all tech
    available on Earth to Simbartia, even the so called agricultural planet will turn gray in a few decades! Like, what
    else can you expect form a technology which pushes a poor planet to extreme ends - the caps are melting, local
    approx temperature is increasing and the land structure is degrading!</p>

<p>
    However painful it was, I kept quite - and never disclosed the tech discovered so far on Earth.
</p>

<P>
    Today, I am quite accustomed to live a life on Earth, though it's a pity that agriculture is such a under paid
    job... However, my life didnt end just there. I proceeded to find new interests and leave the past alone. Well, you
    might be know this funny little thing everyone has a craze for, it's called Programming. It seems amusing - I mean,
    for a race which built a rocket using primitive tools like piling gates and diodes together - being able to just
    type out all that stuff is a real life saver!
</P>

<p>
    Hence, I stared my journey from QBasic - I felt, in a foreign world, I should start from the basics! Later i
    migrated to C language! Ahh those days of me using Turbo C++... DAMN!
</p>

<p>
    Today, I mostly use Java - say anything, like games, bots, servers, loggers, desktop apps, and anything - I prefer
    Java. However, Humans on Earth are really interesting! They tend to discover ways which are even more easy than what
    I always thought is the easiest! Recently Guido Bhai's Python, a languages just slightly older than Java, is today's
    power tool in the world of CSE! It was a bit difficult for me to start because the lack of braces made the program
    look like messy... But it's my favorite tool to solve and study algorithms.

<h3>A list of activities which describe my hobbies:</h3>

<p>I like to bang my fingers on the keyboard to create random projects! Whether be it my synthesizer or my laptop.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Playing Synthesizer</li>
    <li>Day Dream</li>
    <li>Code up unfinished projects - so that I can create teams to complete them.</li>
    <li>Write senseless fantasy text blocks like the one above.</li>
    <li>Think that I can do anything - like Blender, Cubase, Photoshop, Unity...</li>
</ol>
